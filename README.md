# NeuraLark ($LARK) – Official Landing Page & Meme Generator Prompt Repo

Welcome to the **NeuraLark / $LARK** website repo.

This is a simple, static site (just `index.html`) that serves as:
- The **official landing page** for NeuraLark / $LARK  
- A reference for the **canonical jester bird design**  
- A home for prompts / ideas connected to the **NeuraLark meme generator**

> NeuraLark is the AI-powered jester bird of CT – Pepe-style face, duck beak, cyber armor, red/blue jester hat with gold bells, and mechanical ear modules. Same character every time. Different memes.

## 🔮 What is NeuraLark?

**NeuraLark ($LARK)** is a meme coin concept and character:

- **Face:**  
  - Pepe-style facial structure  
  - Duck beak  
  - Expressive, slightly smug CT energy  

- **Jester Hat:**  
  - Split red + blue jester halves  
  - Gold bells on each tip  
  - Slightly chaotic / carnival vibe  

- **Cyborg / AI Details:**  
  - Mechanical ear modules on both sides of the head  
  - Cyber armor chest plate  
  - Metallic feather plating  
  - Blue LED lines and subtle AI glow  

- **Forms:**  
  - Can be **baby** or **adult**, but always the **same jester bird identity**  
  - Style can shift (serious, funny, unhinged), but the **core look never changes**

This repo’s code + README exist to lock that identity in.
